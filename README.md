## To inititialize.
 
Its important to have at least `dk1.8.0_241`, this is because some functions are just available in java EE and new versions dont allow to use it.

First, you need to go to the `Servidor` folder and run the following command from the command prompt:
```
java Servidor
```
Congratulations! Your server is now runing, now you need to connect users.

Go to the `Client` folder and run the following command:
```
java IniciarSesion
```
You have created a window where you can create your user and start chatting with people who are on your same network, you can test this on another computer or just open another command prompt if possible.
